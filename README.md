## <a name="question">‚ùìWhat is? <a/>
  
An Application Programing Interface that simulate a online Library using NodeJS.

  
## <a name="how">:rocket: How to use? <a/>

1. Make the download
2. Open your terminal git bash
3. Open the app folder via the terminal: cd Folder
4. To install al packages from the terminal typing: npm install
4. From the terminal run the project by typing: npm run dev 
5. On a Front-end or API platform connect on the routes.


## <a name="work"> üî® How work?<a/>

With the MVC pattern to organize the application, an API was developed in NodeJS that simulates an online library. Using an abstraction layer with Mongoose (npm package) that allows you to not need to use database codes directly to connect to the MongoDB database. With MongoDB Atlas was used which is a cloud service. CORS was used to allow the application to connect to other front-ends. And to perform the routes and connections the Express library was used. And for security, the Dotenv file was used.
